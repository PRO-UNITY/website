                  Elbrus Bootcamp was founded in 2018 by Georgiy Babayan. His
                  grandfather was a programmer who participated in the creation
                  of the Elbrus microprocessor, hence the name of the school.
                  Georgiy himself went through Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco in
                  2016, one of the oldest bootcamps in America. At that time,
                  this format of education was unheard of in Russia, while in
                  America, it was gaining popularity in the IT industry.

                  Bootcamp provided the opportunity to learn in 3-4 months what
                  previously took years, allowing individuals to acquire a new
                  profession and find a job. Upon his return, Georgiy decided to
                  implement a similar format of education in Russia in two
                  directionsâ€”JavaScript and Data Science. The first Elbrus
                  Bootcamp campus appeared in Moscow, followed by a branch in
                  St. Petersburg, and now you can also study online.

                  The school is staffed by practicing programmers and
                  developers. Each group has its mentors and assistants who help
                  with any questions. One of the key values of Elbrus Bootcamp
                  is the growth mindset: teachers and Bootcamp staff constantly
                  learn and develop to share the most up-to-date knowledge with
                  students.

                      Students choose Elbrus Bootcamp for predictable results,
                      as the school&apos;s main goal is the employment of
                      graduates. Thus, each student has three portfolio projects
                      before graduation: individual, group, and a project from a
                      real customer. After completing the course, all students
                      participate in a series of group and individual sessions
                      with career coaches. Thanks to this approach, 93% of
                      graduates find a job within three months after the
                      courses.

                    Before admission, future programmers undergo a technical
                    interview. This is necessary for students to understand what
                    they will be working on in the coming months and to confirm
                    the seriousness of their intentions. Our curators will tell
